This project aims to develop a self-driving robot car.
The platform is based on Picar-V and Raspberry Pi. Self-driving is based on image processing and CNN.

Steps:
1. Control car with a PS3 remote control and collect images for training
2. Preprocess images to feed the DNN
3. Build and train a DNN
4. Use DNN to drive the robot car
